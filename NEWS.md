# gsmApp 0.6.0

This release is planned to be the pre-`v1.0.0` release and includes some significant changes to the UI, as well as changes that allow the app to be used experimentally on live study data.

## New Features
- Adds site and participant metadata with improved drill-down functionality.
- All charts are linked to the side-panel, so when a site is selected, metadata is presented for the selected site across all tabs.
- The UI has been modified based on user feedback to provide a better experience while navigating the app.

## Other Improvements
- Namespacing and documentation has been updated to be consistent with other R packages and apps in the ecosystem.
